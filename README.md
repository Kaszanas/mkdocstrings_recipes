# Reproduction of mkdocstrings Recipe

This project attempts a reproduction of the automatic API documentation generation using [mkdocstrings Recipes](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/recipes/). Unfortunately provided examples fail at automatically generating API reference documentation. 

Code Reference is pointing towards a route `http://127.0.0.1:8000/reference/SUMMARY/` which displays an empty page.

Further documentation for `mkdocstrings` recipes is required, and a minimal working example would be helpful.
